# OpenEval

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.0.

## Procedure for Completing Issues

1) Create a branch from the remote repo by navigating to the repo's homepage, and clicking on the 'Branch' button near the top left. Title the branch `fb/ISSUENUMBER`. For example, if the issue you are working on is `open-evaluation #1`, title the branch `fb/OE1`. Click to create it.

2) If you have not done so with your current local repo, run `git fetch --all` in order to sync all of your local branches to their remote couterparts when you create them.

3) In VS Code, open your bash terminal, and from the `master` branch, run `git checkout YOURNEWBRANCH`. Make any necessary code changes on that branch and push them to the remote repository when your issue is complete.

4) Once your changes are pushed back to the remote repository, create a pull request for code review. 

## Development server

IMPORTANT: Prior to INITIALLY serving this application, run `npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular` to install all necessary developer dependencies

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
